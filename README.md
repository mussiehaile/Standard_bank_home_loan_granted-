# Standard_bank_home_loan_granted-

in this project, I'm attempting to address a frequent issue we encountered at the bank: the acceptance or refusal of home loans.
The loan officer typically needs at least 2 or 3 days to review the paperwork and assess our application submissions.
Exists a better method to go about this?

Machine learning

We can train a model that can approve or deny loans using past data on loan approvals and denials within a matter of seconds.

Algorithm  

leaverage the power of Auto-machine learning specially auto-sklearn in this case to find the best model that fits our data.

EDA

EDA is the crutial process done to get to know our data .pyton gives us plenty of methods to perform EDA but thair also AUTO-EDA tools out thair.

SWEETVIS is the one i used but thair are other tools outthair.
